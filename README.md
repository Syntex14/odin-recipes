Hi! I am learning how to make websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Currently, I am focusing on using HTML to build the basic structure of a site. Additionally, I am learning how to use Git and GitHub to keep track of my coding progress and projects. 

I am excited to learn the broad field of coding and curious to see where this leads!

Thanks,
